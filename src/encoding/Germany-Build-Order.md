Tradition Opening you need 2 Scouts to search for Barbarians for your Warrior to Kill & Capture.                     |
Purchasing Units early is a good option. Either from passive gold or selling luxuary for money needed.               |

Higher Population.                                        |Less Gold.                                                |
Does not rely on Honor to gain Culture.                   |Failing to Locate & Capture Barbarian Units or losing a Unit early makes you Extremely Vulnerable. |
Completes Tree Early by fully committing to Tradition.    |
Less reliant on RNG to gain advantages.                   |

Honor Opening you need to aggressively Scout to kill & Capture 3+ Barbarians to make up for the loss of +3 early culture|
Purchasing Units early is a good option. Either from passive gold or selling luxuary for money needed.         |

Advantages:                                               |Disadvantages:                                            |
----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
Always know where Barbarian camps are.                    |Relies on RNG to make up for the loss of Culture.         |
More Gold overall due to always knowing where camps are.  |Barbarian Camps Spawning falls off after Turn 100+        |
Potential to earn 5 Policies by Turn 120 (RNG)            |Accelerates early Policy gain at the cost of increasing Policy costs overall. |
Potential to gain more Units than normal (RNG)            |

Goals:                   |Early Objectives    |
-------------------------|--------------------|
4-5 Population by Turn 43|Scout: till Turn 30 |
2-3 Archers by Turn 60   |Focus on Population |
Settler by Turn 63       |
<br>

# Setup: 3 Production Start                      

3 Choices
1: Scout-> Monument-> Granary-> Archer-> Settler [60-63]
<br>
2: Scout-> Scout-> Granary-> Archer-> Worker-> Settler [73-77]
<br>
3: Scout-> Scout-> Monument-> Granary-> Archer-> Settler [67-70]

With a 3 start production you have no choice but to give up something. <br>
Unless you start with Wheat and focus on Granary. This will grow your population to 5 by turn 50. 

Another option is getting a worker early for a Mine/Trapping if you know you won't grow past 4 pop on turn 45.

Either you are giving up double scout and a worker for a Monument, Granary and Archer. <br>
Or you are giving up a Monument/Granary/Archer for the Worker. If all else fails, this is the situation to go Honor first on.

Scout-> Monument-> Granary-> Archer means Archer by Turn 32-40 in this case giving up worker for Double Scout is neccessary.

<br>

# Notes: 

I don't think Germany can give up an Archer. Deity Germany relies heavily on Barbarian Gold and Units to secure the early game.
You either gain 1-2 Archers from Barbarian Camps or use the Gold to Purchase a 2nd Archer by Turn 50. 
Either way Germany needs 2-3 Archers by Turn 60.
<br>
<br>

# Setup: 4 Production Start 

4 Production start (Deer/ etc)
This accelerates your start. You can have 2 scouts and a Monument by turn 24-26 however you'd still have to give up the Worker or Archer.
Double Scout only if you know you can get a worker by Turn 45.

With 5-6 production by Turn 30:
Scout-> Scout-> Monument-> Granary-> Archer-> Worker-> Settler


Turn 1: Scout                      |
Turn 8-10: Monument                |
Turn 20-22: Granary                |
Turn 30-32: Archer                 |
Turn 32-45: Worker                 |



Scout-> Monument-> Granary-> Archer means Archer by Turn 32-40
